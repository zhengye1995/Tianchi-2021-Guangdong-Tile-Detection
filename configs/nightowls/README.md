# NightOwls Dataset

## Introduction

The NightOwls dataset is a dataset for pedestrian detection at night.
It contains three classes ('pedestrian', 'bicycledriver', 'motorbikedriver') except for ignore areas.

## Results

### UniverseNet

Approach:
- We fine-tuned a model from a Waymo Open pre-trained model that fine-tuned from a COCO pre-trained model.
- The weights and biases of the classification layer were transferred using [this script](../../tools/convert_waymo_checkpoint_for_nightowls.py).
- Early stopping was used for the driver classes.
  - 2 epochs w/o background images (4554 iterations)
  - Too early for the pedestrian class

- MR is Miss Rate (%) at Reasonable setting.
- The model was trained and evaluated using fp16 (mixed precision).

- MR is Miss Rate (%) at Reasonable setting. The values are from the organizer's presentation.
- The DeepBlueAI team used Cascade R-CNN, CBNet, Double-Head, DCN, and soft-NMS according to their presentation.
- Considering the method and test scale, UniverseNet should be faster than the runner-up.
- The above-mentioned approach of UniverseNet seems remarkably powerful for motorbikedriver.
